# iw2019-2020-OKTO

## Introduction

This is an university project. In this proyect we are going to develop a web application about a cruise line company, named OKTO (Oil Kills The Ocean). The proyect is separated in four main objectives, which are:

 1. Provide a contextual information point for the clients.
 2. Ease the reservation and purchase on board.
 3. Provide a back-office for the management of system information.
 4. Monitor the activity of the shipping company.
 
We'll have three months for the realization of the web application. Every three weeks a mayor update will be published, and every week we'll update and release minor fixes.
